This week has been incredibly unproductive. A virus on my Windows partition meant a reload for my laptop, which wiped out my Linux partition. The machine was reloaded by Monday morning, and Ubuntu has now been reinstalled. For some reason, though, I cannot get cloud9 to run my programs from HW3. They are giving file path errors. The sample C programs for i2c are also failing to run from terminal. Beginning Monday in class, network is no longer working in Ubuntu even though it works fine under Windows.

In the meantime, I installed Ubuntu on my desktop hoping to make progress over the weekend. I was unable to setup and sync my git repository because our router has been dropping packets and the download would error out.

Where I stand now, my i2c bus is set up properly and I could run the provided sample i2c executables until I recompiled them. Now they hang and I have to CTRL+C out of them.
