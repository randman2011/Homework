I discovered that the assignment did not require using the rotary encoders as input for the etch-a-sketch, so I obtained four push-buttons. The code required modification to accomodate the interrupts, but was very quickly up and running.

In what seems like a never-ending stream of problems, I could not get github to sync on the bone. I originally set it up in the wrong directory and ended up syncing empty folders, so I deleted the repository to start over. This time it wouldn't allow me to connect to a repository at all. This was not resolved until we worked on Monday to fix it.

The board has been wired up to accept the temp sensors and matrix on the i2c bus. I looked into packages that were released to interface with i2c from BoneScript but found that most were abandoned or not yet fully functioning.
